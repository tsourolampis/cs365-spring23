    "In the lecture, we studied the algorithm named Idealized $F_0$ estimation (slide 19). The algorithm uses a random hash function to map elements from the stream to float values between 0 and 1. Ultimately, it maintains the smallest hash value $V$ and outputs ${1\\over V}-1$ as the estimate $\\tilde{F}_0$ for the number of distinct elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "This algorithm uses the idea that the expected value of the smallest hash value is $1\\over F_0+1$, where $F_0$ is the number of distinct elements. In fact, we can generally use the $k$-th smallest hash value $V_k$ for $k=1,2,\\dots$. We will use the results from exercise 4 to conduct experiments to see how different $k$ values affect the accuracy of your estimate."
