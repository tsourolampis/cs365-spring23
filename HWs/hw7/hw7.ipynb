    "# Count min sketch with max heap (25pts)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the class, we studied count-min sketch, an elegant algorithm to estimate the frequency of elements. Here we want to find the top-k frequent elements with one pass over an insert-only stream, using this algorithm. Note that to get top-k elements with only one pass, we must maintain an additional data structure, e.g., a heap, to store the current top-k frequent elements in the stream. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $w$ be the width (num of columns) and $d$ be the depth (num of rows) of the count min sketch. The high-level idea of the algorithm is the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize a heap and a matrix of size $w\\times d$. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each element $e$ coming from the stream, you should update the count min sketch matrix using d different hash functions (as taught in the class). Then, check if the heap size is already k. If no, insert a tuple (the count of $e$, e) into the heap; Else, replace the tuple of the least frequent element in the heap, say $h_0$, with a tuple of (estimated count of $e$, e), **if $e$ has an estimated frequency larger than $h_0$.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the heap will have size at most k, and it stores the (estimated) top-k frequent elements. We need only $O(wd+k)$ words of memory to implement the whole idea. Please implement this algorithm as a class in the cell below."

    "### What is heap and how to use it in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure which is essentially an almost complete tree that satisfies the heap property: in a max heap, for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is greater than or equal to the key of C. A brief introduction can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, the most common implementation of heap can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html). The heapq module implement min heap by storing the data in a list, and exposing all heap-operation APIs needed. You can also find examples of heapq [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/heap-queue-or-heapq-in-python/).  Note when the data stored in the list are tuples, the first element of each tuple will be considered as the \"key\".\n",
